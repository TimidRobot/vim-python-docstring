# TODO
- make option to print simples docstring: one-liner, classic without the intro
- NOT - implement _attributes, _raises, _returns ... generally traversing the tree

- DONE - add epytext and numpy styles

- maybe get rid of colons after each attribute in class (and possibly arg in method) docstring - not everything needs to be explained
